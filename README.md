Overview of Evonet -- An agent-based model for simulating viral evolution in sexual networks.  We have developed “Evonet,” a software package for mathematical modeling of HIV evolution and epidemiology with a user-specified time-evolving sexual network. The model tracks the viral load, CD4 count (discretized into 5 categories), age, sex, sexually transmitted infection (STI) status, circumcision status, condom usage, and the genotypes of viruses in each infected agent. Sexual relationships form and break each day according to an ERGM model of network dynamics. The model includes detailed functions for viral dynamics within each host, and the probability of viral transmission as a function of viral load, age, condom usage, STI and circumcision status, and type of sex (e.g., insertive versus receptive anal intercourse). Rates of progression through CD4 categories and AIDS for patients with different SPVL were extrapolated from data published in Cori et al.4  For the current analysis, relationship dynamics were loosely parameterized for “men-who-have-sex-with-men” (MSM) contact networks within the United States.
